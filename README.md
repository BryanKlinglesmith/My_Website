# CodeLou_FrontEnd

## Description
```

This is a website to tell a little about me and to the projects that I currently have on Github.

This is my project for the Front End Web Development course in Code Louisville.

```



## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. .my-image
        This class is used to give my image a size and make it an oval shape. 

2. .banner
        This class is used to center the content of the flex container and make it wrap to the next line when the screen gets smaller.

3. .projects
        This class makes the width 100% so that this flex container always stays below the primary and secondary columns. The class also aligns the text to the center of the screen.




## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. I made an image modal called (myModal)  
        myModal is used to call an image on click and bring it to the top z level with a dark background to make a "lightbox" effect.  

2. I made a "menu-button" click event on the smallest screen resolution breakpoint
        When the "menu-button" is clicked, the navigation menu is toggled between displayed and hidden.

```
